# NCLDV_filtration
NCLDV_filtration is a jupyter based pipeline to screen the possible NCLDVs from raw bins generated by binning tools, such as Metabat2.
Initially, this work is inspired by a work [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31937645/], where a correlation pattern was observed between the genome size and the number of core genes.
Therefore, we utilized a core gene density index for screening potential giant viruses. In brief, we selected 20 marker genes of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Virus Orthologous Groups (NCVOGs), which are universal or nearly universal present across all known giant virus families.

## Verification
We used a reference dataset, including Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota genomes, as well as a NCLDV reference dataset to assess whether this work is effective.

## Dependencies
The pipeline is written in Python v3.9.16.
The pipeline requires Prodigal and HMMER3 for gene call and HMM searches.
